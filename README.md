<h2>Overview</h2>

In today's world, dogs are more than just pets; they are cherished members of our families. Their companionship and ability to resonate with human emotions make them integral to many households[1]. Recognizing this deep bond, there is a need to empower dog owners, especially those lacking medical knowledge, to take proactive and informed steps in maintaining their pets' health.

Many dog owners, despite their best intentions, face challenges in providing proper healthcare for their pets. This is often due to a lack of accessible and reliable information on dog health, like in areas such as nutrition and early sickness detection with corresponding treatment [2]. As a result, minor health issues can escalate, leading to frequent and sometimes unnecessary veterinary visits, increased medical costs in timely and monetary aspects, and, most importantly, discomfort or pain for the pet.
Our product aims to address this gap by developing an app/platform that guides dog owners in maintaining their pets' health through healthy diets/recipes and immediate strategies for sickness. The goal is to equip owners with the knowledge and tools necessary to make immediate, informed decisions about their pets' health, thereby reducing the frequency of unnecessary and delayed veterinary visits and enhancing the overall well-being and lifespan of their pets.

By providing easy-to-use, vet-approved information on dog nutrition and health, the app will empower owners to take charge of their pets' well-being. Moreover, the platform will offer guidance on recognizing early signs of illness, enabling prompt and appropriate responses, which can prevent minor issues from becoming major health problems. The app shall also provide immediate treatment to the dog if there is any symptom emerges, which lowers the risk of overlong exposure.

Besides, tailored diet plans and health tips based on the specific breed, age, and health condition of the dog will ensure that each pet receives the most suitable care. Thus, equipping owners with the knowledge to manage minor health issues and maintain a healthy lifestyle for their pets, reduces the need for frequent and unnecessary veterinary visits.

In short, the platform seeks to contribute to a higher quality of life and a longer lifespan for pets by promoting preventive healthcare and immediate help when there are any symptoms. This project is not just about creating an app but fostering a community of informed and empowered pet owners. By bridging the knowledge gap in pet healthcare, we aim to create a world where every dog enjoys a healthier, happier life, and every owner feels confident and equipped to care for their furry friend.
